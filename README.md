# OVERVIEW :
- This paper presents the development of Augmented Reality (AR) for smart campus urbanization using library as the environment for the demonstration of the AR prototype.
- This application is developed using Vuforia software to set the image marker-based and process the output into Unity3D software, Android Studio for the Main Menu interface and IBM Watson for voice recognition.
- The final form of the application is successfully generated from the development of Augmented Reality (AR) application for the smart campus by using a library for the demonstration of the AR prototype.

# PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
1. SYSTEM PLANING : Navigation Design, Image Design
2. REGISTERING IMAGE TARGET: Vuforia
3. DESIGNING AR OBJECT : Unity, IBM Watson

# RESULT
VIRTUAL WORLD : In this study, the entire library space is utilized as an AR environment. Each room is filled with objects and navigation buttons that can facilitate users in exploring the campus library.
SENSORY FEEDBACK AND INTERACTIVITY : In this study, the AR application built has also adapted aspects of interactivity and sensory feedback. For example, when a user enters the library for the first time and activates the camera sensor, a voice prompt will appear instructing them to scan their ID card along with directional cues to the ID scan location. Additionally, each room door is equipped with information about the destination location.

# EVALUATION
- 16 students and 4 librarians have been chosen to experience the AR applications at different scenes using their own smartphone device
- There are 14 questions for them to answer directly using provided google form after the test are conducted. The questionnaires include the user profile background, the usefulness of the application, the ease of using the application, satisfaction of the application, representation of the user interface, and comment on how to improve it.

- Usefulness 75%
- Easy to use 80%
- Satisfaction 60%
- Representation 70%

# CONCLUSION
- This project main contribution is to design and produce mobile application consist of interfaces of Augmented Reality on Android open-source system to testify the proficiency of virtual information shown on the screen and the viability of augmented object plotted at every section of the library.

- After applying the user testing such as multi-image target and choosing random participants to try the application with several questionnaires provided, the outcome is generated accurately as the virtual image are displayed with a sharp movement and stay at the right location.

- Hence, implementing this system into the library could reduce the usage of plastic things such as banner and stickers leading toward a go green campaign.
